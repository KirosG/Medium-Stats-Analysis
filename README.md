# Medium-Engagement-Stats
Exploratory data analysis and metric analysis of user-specific Medium Stats

The goal is to collect baseline stats on stories from https://medium.com/me/stats in order to get a better understanding of how readers engage with a writers work. Note that this is a personal project and is in no way associated with Medium.

It's worth noting that this type of analysis should be available to all writers, not just those that are data science practioners. Data analysis should be democratized for writers and content creators. Even with my ~30 post sample size, I was able to walk away with some interesting insights:
* 2 out of my 30+ posts make up over 70% of my total lifetime views
* `Read Ratio` and `Read Time` appear to be strongly correlated
* Publication choice matters for enjoyment stats like Fan Ratio
* `Read Ratio` and `Fan Ratio` correlated - strong posts do both well

Note that this analysis is just from using the fraction of data available to users on the Medium Stats page. Imagine if we had more of our data and information at our disposal; if writers were empowered to use Medium Stats for improving their work and understanding how readers perceive it rather than boosting their ego with simple vanity stats. It's no small task, but I believe it can be done.

Hope you enjoyed this project, I know I did. Once again, reiterating that I am in no way affiliated with or working for Medium. However, you can follow my writing at the link below if interested. Thanks for reading!
